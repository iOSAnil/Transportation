# Design Pattern
MVVM + Coordinator + ViewStates

- Model: Response decodable model objects
- View(or ViewController): ViewController embedded with a view, handling UI events received from UI elements and dispatch the events to ViewModel. ViewController registered the viewModel publishers and render the UI with the latest ViewState.
- ViewModel: Handling the triggered events from viewController. Call APIContext (injected from coordinator), received response, convert to ViewStates and publish with the help of publisher. 

Best practices:

- Network Manager is created which will be helpful at any point if the project needs to change the third party library from Alamofire to anything else.
- App is free from leaks and tested with leaks and allocation tool. 
- Protocol interfacing for most of the layer to help in the test cases and reusability prescpective.
- ViewController only reacting to ViewStates. (No hardcoding of showing/Removing loaders)
- Since Apple is moving towards SwiftUI (declarative code for UI creation) This project is being created without using any XIB or Storyboards.
- Warning is created to showcase that demokey is used for the project.

# XCUnitTestCases

- URLProtocol is used to intercept the network layer response.
- ViewModel is being tested with MockAPIContext.

# XCUITestCases

Page Object Model: Design pattern used for organising and maintaining the UI elements of a mobile application in a structured manner. 

- Pages Responsibility: To create the XCUIElements and methods provoking operation on them.
- TestCase Responsibility: To call the screen  the XCUIElements and methods provoking operation on them.
- BaseClassForTestCases: Helper method with Asserts.

Best practices Used:

- BaseClassForTestCases has all the Assertâ€™s which help to have clear code on the test cases and pages classes.
